   - Created utilities for input generation and output verification
   - Added performance comparison and reporting

5. Created GPU Test Infrastructure (`tests/test_cuda_kernels.py`):

   - Implemented mock CUDA compiler and profiler
   - Added realistic metric simulation
   - Created mock kernel execution environment
   - Added device property simulation

8. Updated Test Infrastructure:
   - Modified tests to support both real and mock CUDA
   - Added test markers for GPU-specific tests
   - Implemented mock data generation
   - Added cleanup routines

### Phase 4: Enhanced Development Environment Setup

9. Enhanced Development Environment:
   - Created mock CUDA environment for local development
   - Added automatic CUDA availability detection
   - Implemented mock metrics generation
   - Updated test suite to support both real and mock environments

10. Test Infrastructure Updates:
    - Added pytest configuration for test markers
    - Created basic tests that run without CUDA
    - Added skip conditions for GPU-specific tests
    - Implemented cleanup routines for test artifacts

### Development Workflow

For cost-efficient development:

1. Local Development (Free):
   - Use mock CUDA environment for development and testing
   - Run basic tests with `pytest -m basic`
   - Validate code structure and logic
   - Test PyTorch integration locally

2. Cloud GPU Testing (Pay-as-you-go):
   - Use Google Colab (Free tier) for initial GPU testing
   - Run full test suite with real GPU: `pytest -m "not basic"`
   - Profile actual CUDA performance
   - Validate against KernelBench baselines

3. Production Testing:
   - Use GitHub Actions with GPU runners for CI/CD
   - Run comprehensive benchmarks on cloud GPU instances
   - Compare against PyTorch eager mode baseline

### Current Status

Local Development Environment:
- Mock CUDA compiler and profiler working
- Basic tests passing
- KernelBench integration with mock data
- Test infrastructure ready for both environments

### Next Steps

1. Create Google Colab notebook for GPU testing:
   - Set up CUDA toolkit and dependencies
   - Import project code and tests
   - Run full test suite with real GPU
   - Generate performance reports

2. Add real KernelBench tasks:
   - Download and cache KernelBench dataset
   - Implement more Level-1 tasks
   - Add performance regression tests

3. Enhance mock environment:
   - Improve performance simulation accuracy
   - Add more realistic error conditions
   - Implement memory usage tracking
